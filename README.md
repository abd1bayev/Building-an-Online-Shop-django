<h3>Creating an image bookmarking website</h3>
We will now learn how to allow users to bookmark images that they find on other websites and share them on our site. To build this functionality, we will need the following elements:

1. A data model to store images and related information
2. A form and a view to handle image uploads
3. JavaScript bookmarklet code that can be executed on any website. This code will find images
across the page and allow users to select the image they want to bookmark
